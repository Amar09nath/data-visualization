Review
good company if you want to learn and grow . sometimes Improper project allocation.
"Very interesting, cool life, No stress while working , excellent company "
"it was very great working with Accenture , quite good, need to improve canteen facilities."
"No good culture , only bad politics."
Competitive and inNovative workspace.good environment but bad HR.
"Good work , but promotion Not good "
"Push for skill Development , more reservation foe womens"
"Working environment is very good , co-workers are supportive, good opportunities for career growth "
"Poor administrative services, lots of work load , less resources"
They dont consider the hard work of people until the person is fed up of the project and sends a resignation letter. It completely depends on the people who are managing you
"getting less salary, but job is interesting "
"i have learn a lot of skills , i joined as Executive , then got promoted ,good place to work "
"Remote job , firing out the employees who has weak performance specially during panademic."
"Job security for women is very good, team Management is worst"
"Overall good company , job security good , Management is Normal , got to learn many things "
Worst experience
"Lots of opportunities for growth , impressive programs , flexible on moving from one project to aNother"
"Liked training , salary , cab , i disliked politics and shift"
"Great company , good Management"

"job security, company policy are good"
"i liked their credit salary , bad culture"
one of the best organization to start your career as a fresher . loved it thank you Infosys
Low salary hikes for long term employees.  Senior Management didn't care.
There is a lot of politics and the Management doesn’t address our issues. Salary is decent but career growth is slow. There is a bond of 2 years before which you canNot resign. On the job training is Not given to new joinees.
1% 2% annual hike and zero recognition of talent in lower job levels. The record high attrition rate in the last 2 quarters can majorly be attributed to compensation. It's Not something unique to Infy. All companies give millions to lateral hires and throw pennies at existing employees.
"Good work environment and work culture is good, too. The biggest disappointing factor in Infosys is hikes and appraisals. "
"Low salary hikes for long time employees.Great job security, great learning platform (LEX)"
Compensation benefits Not in line with market otherwise good company to start with 
joob security is good and compensation is Not good 
teammates are supportive but politics is at top 
work life balance is Not good  but it has good job security
"Dislikes Average working policy , Less promotion slots
Management least bothered about your designation and what work you are doing.
Less promotion slots"
Most of the Infosys employee would dislike only the salary offered. Those who join Infosys with better salary can sail through.
"good training program , guidance in career growth, Not great compensation "
"good environment , nice work life balance , good job security , salary and compensation is low"
training is really helpful to increase your kNowledge and personality
"Salary to freshers is little bit low as compared to TCS , good Job security and skill Development and learning"
"I felt very lucky to be a part of Infosys. And I love infy campus very much, then it's a great place to learn things especially for freshers"
Infosys is too much System based. I got my leaves deducted becuase I missed to apply wfh for a day.
"I love infy campus very much, then it's a great place to learn things especially for freshers , don't like the infy salary packages "
"Best place to work ,Compensation is less .but again that's the case for all the service based companies."
"Compensation is often quite low and the variable component is frequently given less than 80% , job security is good"
" Excellent organization with good work culture , Interesting and positive environment to work with."
"Job security wise Infosys is best, working culture is awesome, My overall experience is best at Infy. "
"Good work environment, Good work life balance , Excellent training, Lack of career growth,Low salary and low increment, Difficult to switch Tech profile,"
"good work culture, good learning opportunities but sometimes you will be mapped to the project Not relevant to your skillsets"
Good work environment and culture.Teammates are supportive and Management is transparent.Company policies are good.
"Not recommended to join as a fresher, slow career growth, less compensations/salary"
"Learning and good platform to start the carrier , Learning platforms like trendnxt are very bad. Management politics will differ project to project."

During the COVID-19 adobe has declared the WFH till July 2021 and also given the $500 to each employee to buy the required things to get work done from home
Now days very bad work culture has come where they hire people on Contract basis and dont give them any appraisal and opportunities to convert full time employee so that they can save thier money.

In this COVID time organization monitor employees on time and off time thru some software.. already I'm facing salary cut and with this if they monitor you via software.. later management might do mental harrasment which happened to some employees as well
"No transparency, . HR never take sessions to understand your pain or to address your queries. . Policies are written in such a diplomatic way thay one can't understand"
"They will Not give other benefits. There is No night shift allowence and Holiday allowence, if we are asking about, they will tell that's the policy."
"Job security and work-life balance is good here. I love working here. In COVID they are really treating us well with health checkup and facilities like tests and all at our doorstep.

Best salary hike in my career
Awesome work experience and balanced work life No proper growth in terms of salary and promotions
"Low compensation, 24/7 work culture, biased decision of managers"
It's very hard to get out of a domain which you don't want. The managers don't listen to your requests. They ratings are completely baseless. Even if you perform well you can get bad rating.
"Salary, Hike and incentives are too low. Mangers politics, No work-life balance."

Everything bad
Pathetic
"Good work environment culture , Less hikes compared to current market"
Overall good work experience
"First is TCS has best learning platform like Udemy, safari books, linkdin, fresco play where it helps everyone to learn and grow their career. worklifebalance, culture, opportunities. you get on-site if you are lucky and u have good skills."
Good work life balance and employee friendly organisation . Career growth is good. Training is available for better opportunities
Good environment & culture . Policy is good and fair with lot of opportunities to grow within the organization. Salary hike is decent each year based on company standards.
The job security at TCS is the most appealing aspect. You can upskill yourself with lots of free and authentic learning portals at your fingertips.
TCS has the brand name with itself.They have good onsite opportunities.HR policies and job security is perfect.Management is Not so good and they have been there from so many years
Health insurance and term plan politics. Good supportive management. They provide me all support always.Compensation is worst
Onsite opportunity. Mostly good team mates. Good health insurance. job security is there

Truth by saying that No proper team leader everything goes under politics and waste of team bonding and all.
"Great work life balance .. but it depends on project , Compensation and salary is low"
"work environment isn't good, growth and opportunity is slow"
Work environment isn't good
Not much opportunities provided and too much politics involved. No work-life balance. Worked every weekend and No overtime pay. it's high time companies either start paying overtime or recruit correct No. of people actually required for the project!
disliked Hike and opportunities
Tcs is a very good organisation however it is Not good for freshers and to learn new things and also it doesn't have growth
Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supprtive nd management is transparent
Work life balance is what one can be satisfied with in TCS. Great to place to work.
Job security is the main component every employee dreams of and there is No other place as secure as TCS for an employee.
No growth
good environment
Less salary and benefits. Experience is considered over talent.
Less salary and benefits. 
Loved work culture as I enjoyed my work life balance. Supportive teammates and understanding managers.
Each day is still Day 1 in Amazon. Lot of learning opportunities to improve your skillset. Work culture and compensation is one of the best in industry.
Slow career growth.
The Recruiters don't respond. Even if you reach out multiple times. Poor coordination.
disliked Career growth

homely work culture great supervisors and great support
"It feels good working in Amazon however, growth opportunities are Not there and pay is Not balanced as compare to the work that needs to be done"
Job security is high and work culture is awesome
Boring. It's a work from home culture so No socialization or No fun activity is conducted on regular basis
There is No scope for growth in the process. You'll be movinh to different transformatoons but there is No skill development at all. The hike provided will also be very low.
Nothing is likeable
Awesome work culture
Far better then others companies
What I like about the company work culture and the working enviorment.
